    "Description": "You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible\nphenomenon that is no larger than a 20 foot cube. The image appears at\na spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It\nseems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature\nappropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or\ncold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or\ndeafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a\ntroglodyte's stench).\n\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your\naction to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As\nthe image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its\nmovements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an\nimage of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it\nappears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make\ndifferent sounds at different times, even making it carry on a\nconversation, for example.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\nbecause things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to\nexamine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a\nsuccessful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save\nDC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature\ncan see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint\nto the creature.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of\n6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring\nyour concentration.",

If you cast this spell on the same\ncreature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it\neach time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.\n\n**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and\nmagical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You\ncan make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear\nnonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to\nbelong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this\neffect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any\ncreature that handles the item.\n\n**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical\neffects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or\nthe trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other\nspells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of\nthat type or of that alignment.",

The transformation lasts for the\nduration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you\nconcentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation\nlasts until it is dispelled.\n\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit\npoints. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it\nsucceeds, it isn't affected by this spell.\n\n**Creature into Creature.** If you turn a creature into another kind of\ncreature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge\nrating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the\ntarget doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics,\nincluding mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the\nnew form. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts\nto its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it\nhad before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0\nhit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long\nas the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit\npoints, it isn't knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of\nits new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action\nthat requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such\nactions.\n\nThe target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate,\nuse, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\n**Object into Creature.** You can turn an object into any kind of\ncreature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's\nsize and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is\nfriendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You\ndecide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature's\nstatistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\n\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature.

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or\ncast this spell again.\n\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.\nIt can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of\ndrums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated\nthroughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different\ntimes before the spell ends.\n\nIf you create an image of an object -- such as a chair, muddy\nfootprints, or a small chest -- it must be no larger than a 5 foot\ncube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory\neffect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an\nillusion, because things can pass through it.\n\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the\ncreature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a\ncreature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes\nfaint to the creature.",

You\ncan use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\n\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's\nduration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets\none of your duplicates.\n\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the\nattack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8\nor higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\n\nA duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits\na duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed\nonly by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and\neffects.  The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\n\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on\nsenses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive\nillusions as false, as with truesight.",

At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance\nopens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.\n\nThe extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the\nrope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures.\nThe rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from\nview outside the space.\n\nAttacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the\nextradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if\nthrough a 3 foot by 5 foot window centered on the rope.\n\nAnything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell\nends.",
